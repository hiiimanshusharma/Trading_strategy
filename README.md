# Trading_strategy
The trading strategy involves two simple rules based on daily historical data of the Bank Nifty stock index from 2007 to 2023:

1. Long Entry (Buy Signal):
   - Buy the Bank Nifty if the current day's high is 0.5% or more higher than the previous day's closing price.

2. Short Entry (Sell Signal):
   - Sell the Bank Nifty short if the current day's low is 0.5% or more lower than the previous day's closing price.

These rules guide trading decisions: buying when there's upward momentum and selling short when there's downward momentum, aiming to profit from short-term price movements.
